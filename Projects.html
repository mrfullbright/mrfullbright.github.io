        <h5>Assistance League: Operation School Bell</h5>
        <p>For our final project in my Databases class, we were instructed to construct a functioning mock database for the Assistance League, a non-profit organization that is dedicated
        to serving the community. Their program, Operation School Bell, assists children and provides them with clothing for the school year. Our team utilized flowcharts, SQL, and ERDs
        to construct our database that the Assistance League could use to keep track of inventory.</p>

        <h5>Github Repositories</h5>
        <p>During my time in MIS 3013 and MIS 3033, we have learned how to use Github. Github is an excellent way to store codes into repositories that we create and to analyze
        different codes created by other users. I have stored various files of codes that were used for participation and homework assignments for my programming classes.</p>
