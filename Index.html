    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Matthew. I am creating my very own website for my programming class.
        A little bit about myself: I am a junior, I am majoring in Management Information Systems, and I am
        set to graduate this time next year. I have learned so much in this programming class and now I am
        applying my HTML and CSS skills by creating this website. On the navigation bar, you will find some
        additional information about myself, the projects I have accomplished, and the skills that I have 
        learned.
    </p>
    <h4>Purpose of the site:</h4>
    <p>This site's purpose is to give myself some additional experience working with HTML and CSS. You will be able to find much information about my
        education, my volunteer and my programming experiences! I hope you like what you see! Enjoy!
    </p>
